# Incorrect Number Flagging (INF)

## What problem does it solve

Incorrect, changed, disconnected numbers are usually not reported to the district by parents/contacts and are not discovered until some form of communication to the number fails.  This allows users to flag and easily notify the districtâ€™s technical custodian of changes, solving a major pain point for the district and ensuring an action for correction is initiated.
